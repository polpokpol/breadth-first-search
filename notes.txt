BFS CLASS:

in this code, first we print the root and next is its
neighbors and after such, the neighbors of its neighbors and so on
also known as their child.

to do this, we will implement a queue and a linkedlist to print the
correct order of data.

first we setvisited the root to TRUE and append the root to the linkedlist and delete & transfer to 
another variable then print that variable.

iterate the variable neighbors and set it to visited if not yet visited and append it to
the queue to wait for its turn since it is a FIFO structure.

the same will happen to every element of the linkedlist. it gets deleted and printed out
and if it has a neighbor it will go to the queue until the queue is empty
